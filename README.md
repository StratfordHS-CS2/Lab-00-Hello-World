# Lab 00 - Hello World

You will be completing a simple Hello World lab as an introduction to GitHub Classroom, and so we can make sure everything is working correctly.

## Instructions
1. Click on the "Work in REPL.it" button to open this repository on REPL.
2. Edit only the file *main.py*.
3. Add a **print** statement in the main method to print out "Hello World!".
4. Run your code and check the result.
5. Click on the "Version Control" icon on the left, just below the "Files" icon.
6. Enter a brief message in the box where it says "What did you change?"  For example: "Fixed output" or "lab complete".
7. Click the "Commit & push" button. This saves your changes back to GitHub. **If you skip this step then your modifications will not be saved anywhere!**  It is a good idea to commit and push after you complete a section of code to make sure your progress is saved.
8. Go to GitHub and check if it passed all of the tests.  You should already have run the code yourself so you should have a good idea what the results of the tests will be.
